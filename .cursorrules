Okay, let's break down the process of building this secure file-sharing web application. As an experienced software engineer, I'll guide you through a structured brainstorming and planning phase, focusing on each component and its interaction.

I. Core Feature Breakdown and Planning:

A. User Authentication and Authorization:

Registration:

Frontend (React):

Create a registration form with fields for username, email, and password.

Implement input validation (basic format checks).

Send a POST request to the backend's /api/register/ endpoint with user details.

Handle success/error responses (e.g., display success message, show error messages).

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a Django REST Framework (DRF) serializer to validate registration data.

Create a view (using DRF's APIView or ModelViewSet) to handle the /api/register/ endpoint.

Inside the view:

Deserialize the request data using the serializer.

If valid, hash the password using bcrypt (Django provides utility functions for this).

Create a new user object in the database.

Return a success response (e.g., HTTP 201 Created).

Login with MFA:

Frontend (React):

Create a login form with fields for username/email and password.

Send a POST request to the backend's /api/login/ endpoint with credentials.

MFA Flow:

If the initial login is successful, the backend might respond indicating MFA is required.

The backend should send information about the MFA method (e.g., "TOTP").

Display a second form to collect the MFA code (e.g., TOTP code).

Send another POST request to a specific MFA verification endpoint (e.g., /api/verify-mfa/) with the MFA code and potentially a session identifier.

Upon successful MFA verification, the backend sends the JWT.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a DRF serializer to validate login data.

Create a login view:

Authenticate the user using Django's built-in authentication system (authenticate).

If authentication is successful, check if MFA is enabled for the user.

MFA Setup (if not already done):

For TOTP, generate a secret key (using a library like pyotp).

Store the secret key securely associated with the user.

Return a response to the frontend indicating MFA setup is needed (potentially with the secret key or a QR code for the authenticator app).

MFA Verification:

Create a separate view for /api/verify-mfa/.

Receive the MFA code and potentially a session identifier.

Retrieve the user's stored MFA secret.

Verify the TOTP code using the secret and the received code.

If verification is successful, generate a JWT using a library like djangorestframework-simplejwt.

Send the JWT back to the frontend (ideally in an HTTP-only, secure cookie).

Logout:

Frontend (React):

Clear the stored JWT from local storage or cookies.

Redirect the user to the login page.

Optionally, send a request to the backend's /api/logout/ endpoint to invalidate any server-side sessions (though with JWT, this is less critical if the token expires).

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a logout view (optional).

For JWT-based authentication, the primary logout is handled client-side by discarding the token. The backend might offer a logout endpoint to blacklist tokens if needed (more complex).

Rule-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Database (SQLite):

Create database models for User, Role, and potentially Permission.

Establish relationships: a User belongs to one or more Roles, a Role can have multiple Permissions.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Define roles (Admin, Regular User, Guest) as constants or in the database.

Define permissions (e.g., can_manage_users, can_upload_files, can_view_shared).

Use Django's built-in permission system or a library like django-guardian for object-level permissions.

In API views, check the user's role or permissions before allowing actions. Decorators like @permission_classes (from DRF) can be used.

Frontend (React):

The frontend UI should adapt based on the user's role (fetched from the backend after login and stored in the Redux state). Hide or disable features based on permissions.

B. File Upload and Encryption:

File Upload:

Frontend (React):

Use an <input type="file"> element to allow users to select files.

Implement a secure file transfer mechanism using FormData and fetch or a library like axios.

Display progress indicators during the upload.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a DRF serializer to handle file uploads.

Create an API view to handle the /api/upload/ endpoint (using POST).

In the view:

Validate the uploaded file (e.g., size, type).

Get the current user from the JWT.

Client-Side Encryption (Before Upload):

Frontend (React):

Use the Web Crypto API (crypto.subtle) to encrypt the file content before sending it to the backend.

Key Generation/Management: This is a crucial security point. Consider these options (with varying complexity and security trade-offs):

User-Specific Key: Generate a unique encryption key for each user. Store this key securely (encrypted) on the server, accessible only after successful user authentication. The user's password could be involved in deriving this key.

Symmetric Key per File: Generate a unique symmetric key for each uploaded file. Encrypt the file with this key. Encrypt the file's symmetric key using the user's public key (if using asymmetric encryption) or a user-specific symmetric key managed on the server.

Encrypt the file data using AES (e.g., crypto.subtle.encrypt).

Send the encrypted file data to the backend.

Server-Side Encryption at Rest:

Backend (Django REST Framework):

When the backend receives the (already potentially client-side encrypted) file:

Generate a unique server-side encryption key for this file (using a secure random number generator).

Encrypt the file content again using AES-256 with this server-side key.

Store the encrypted file in your chosen storage (e.g., file system, cloud storage).

Key Management: Securely store the server-side encryption key associated with the file. Options:

Separate Key Management System (KMS): For production, this is the best practice.

Encrypted Key in Database: Encrypt the server-side key using a master key.

Environment Variable (Less Secure, for local dev only):

Store metadata about the file in the database (filename, user ID, encryption information, etc.).

File Download and Decryption:

Frontend (React):

When a user requests a download, send a request to the backend's /api/download/<file_id>/ endpoint.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Authenticate the user and check if they have permission to download the file.

Retrieve the encrypted file from storage.

Retrieve the server-side encryption key for the file.

Decrypt the file content using AES-256.

Option 1: Server-Side Decryption and Re-Encryption (Less Secure): Decrypt on the server and then potentially encrypt again for transit (using HTTPS). This means the server handles the decryption keys, increasing the attack surface.

Option 2: Send Encrypted Data and Key (More Secure): Send the server-side encrypted file data and the necessary decryption key information to the client securely.

If client-side encryption was used, the backend might need to send the client-side decryption key (if managed server-side).

If only server-side encryption was used, the backend needs to securely transmit the server-side decryption key to the client (this is complex and needs careful consideration of key exchange).

Frontend (React):

If the backend sent the encrypted data and a decryption key:

Use the Web Crypto API to decrypt the file using the received key.

Trigger a download of the decrypted file in the browser.

C. File Sharing with Access Control:

Sharing with Specific Users:

Frontend (React):

Provide a UI to select a file and users to share with.

Allow setting permissions (view, download).

Send a request to the backend's /api/share/ endpoint with file ID, user IDs, and permissions.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a database model (e.g., FileShare) to store sharing information (file ID, user ID, permissions).

Create an API view to handle the /api/share/ endpoint.

Authenticate the sharing user and verify they have permission to share the file.

Create entries in the FileShare table.

Secure Shareable Links:

Frontend (React):

Provide a UI to generate a shareable link for a file.

Allow setting an expiration time.

Send a request to the backend's /api/generate-share-link/ endpoint.

Backend (Django REST Framework):

Create a database model (e.g., ShareLink) to store link information (file ID, unique token, expiration time, permissions).

Create an API view to handle the /api/generate-share-link/ endpoint.

Generate a unique, random token for the link.

Store the link details in the database.

Return the generated shareable link to the frontend.

Create a separate API view to handle accessing files via shareable links (e.g., /share/<token>/).

When a user accesses the shareable link:

Validate the token and ensure it hasn't expired.

Retrieve the associated file and permissions.

Grant access based on the permissions.

II. Technical Requirements Deep Dive:

Frontend (React): Focus on component-based architecture, using hooks for state management within components where appropriate, and Redux for global application state (user authentication, potentially file lists).

Backend (Django REST Framework): Leverage Django's ORM, authentication system, and DRF for building the API.

Database (SQLite): Suitable for development. Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.

III. Security Requirements - Critical Considerations:

SSL/TLS: Essential. For local development, generate self-signed certificates using openssl. In production, use a trusted certificate authority like Let's Encrypt.

Password Security: Use Django's built-in password hashing (bcrypt). Never store plain text passwords.

Input Validation: Crucial on both frontend and backend.

Frontend: Basic checks for format, length, etc. Provide immediate feedback to the user.

Backend: Mandatory. Use DRF serializers to validate all incoming data before processing. Protect against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

Session Management (JWT):

Use httpOnly and secure flags for cookies storing the JWT to prevent JavaScript access and ensure transmission over HTTPS.

Set appropriate expiration times for JWTs (consider short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens).

Implement proper storage of JWTs on the frontend (e.g., in httpOnly cookies, or if in local storage, be aware of XSS risks).

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Django provides middleware for CSRF protection. Ensure it's enabled and understand how it works with AJAX requests from the React frontend.

Regular Security Audits: Plan for periodic security reviews of your code.

Dependency Management: Keep your dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.

Content Security Policy (CSP): Configure CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.

IV. Expectations - Emphasizing Key Aspects:

Security First: Every design decision should consider security implications. Think about the "what ifs" and potential vulnerabilities.

Code Quality: Adhere to coding standards (PEP 8 for Python, consistent React style). Use meaningful variable names, write clear comments, and follow SOLID principles.

Encryption Proficiency: Demonstrate a solid understanding of encryption concepts (symmetric vs. asymmetric, encryption at rest vs. in transit, key management).

Testing:

Unit Tests: Test individual components (backend views, frontend components, utility functions).

Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different parts of the application (e.g., API endpoints).

End-to-End Tests (Optional): Simulate user workflows to test the entire application.

Dockerization:

Create separate Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend.

Use docker-compose.yml to define and manage the multi-container application (frontend, backend, database).

Ensure the Docker setup is well-documented and easy to launch.
always use python3 instead of python as my system only uses python3 and for fronttend always use bun instead of npm.
before starting the backend or frontend always make sure you are in the right directory.
